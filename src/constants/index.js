So, there are several cases where people bitten by street dogs and there are only few cases where people die because of rabies.

Luckily there are communities willing to save street dogs out of their misery and give them a comfortable living during the short span of years they live. Dogee is one of the major organizations in Sri Lanka that helps street dogs. The web portal is used by the Dogee organization.
